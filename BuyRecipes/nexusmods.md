Buy cooking recipes from the SMAPI console!

Now that this mod has 10+ endorsements, I'll schedule in development to allow you to buy recipes from a magazine rack in Pierre's shop.

Each week on Sunday a new set of up to five cooking recipes will be available to buy. These will be recipes that you do not already own. Prices are listed next to each item.
