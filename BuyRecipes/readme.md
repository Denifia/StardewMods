## Configuration

The mod will work fine out of the box, but you can tweak its settings by editing the `config.json`
file if you want. These are the available settings:

| setting           | what it affects
| ----------------- | -------------------
| `CheckForUpdates` | Default `true`. Whether the mod should check for a newer version when you load the game. If a new version is available, you'll see a small message at the bottom of the screen for a few seconds. This doesn't affect the load time even if your connection is offline or slow, because it happens in the background.
