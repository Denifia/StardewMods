**Buy Recipes** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which lets you 
buy cooking recipes from the SMAPI console.

Each week on Sunday a new set of up to five recipes will be available to buy. These 
will be recipes that you do not already own. Prices are listed next to each item.

_If the recipe name has a space in it, put quotes around the name (like in the screenshot below)_
