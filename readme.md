This repository contains my SMAPI mods for Stardew Valley. See the individual mods for

Note: I wrote these mods myself but took a lot of inspiration (and some helper code) from Pathoschild.

* [Send Items](SendItems) - Send items to your other farms (saved games) or other players from around the world.
* [Buy Recipes](BuyRecipes) - Purchase recipes you don't know from a magazine rack in Pierre's shop.
